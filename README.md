# Bitcoin Yield Aggregator

A secure and efficient DeFi yield strategy management system built on Bitcoin using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

The Bitcoin Yield Aggregator enables users to:

- Deposit tokens into various yield-generating protocols
- Manage protocol allocations dynamically
- Earn and claim rewards based on protocol performance
- Benefit from automated strategy rebalancing

## Key Features

- **Protocol Management**: Add, update, and manage yield-generating protocols
- **Token Integration**: SIP-010 compliant token support with whitelisting
- **Secure Deposits**: Rate-limited deposits with comprehensive validation
- **Dynamic Rewards**: APY-based reward calculation and distribution
- **Emergency Controls**: Emergency shutdown mechanism for risk management
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse through operation rate limiting

## Security Features

- Protocol whitelisting
- Emergency shutdown mechanism
- Rate limiting
- Comprehensive input validation
- Balance verification
- SIP-010 compliance checks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain environment
- SIP-010 compliant tokens
- Clarity smart contract knowledge

### Contract Deployment

1. Deploy the contract to the Stacks blockchain
2. Set initial parameters (platform fee, deposit limits)
3. Whitelist supported tokens
4. Add yield-generating protocols

### Usage

```clarity
;; Deposit tokens
(contract-call? .yield-aggregator deposit token-trait amount)

;; Withdraw tokens
(contract-call? .yield-aggregator withdraw token-trait amount)

;; Claim rewards
(contract-call? .yield-aggregator claim-rewards token-trait)
```

## Architecture

The contract is structured into several key components:

- Protocol Management
- Token Management
- Deposit/Withdrawal Handling
- Reward Distribution
- Administrative Controls
